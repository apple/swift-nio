## How to submit a bug report

Please ensure to specify the following:

* SwiftNIO commit hash
* Contextual information (e.g. what you were trying to achieve with SwiftNIO)
* Simplest possible steps to reproduce
  * More complex the steps are, lower the priority will be.
  * A pull request with failing test case is preferred, but it's just fine to paste the test case into the issue description.
* Anything that might be relevant in your opinion, such as:
  * Swift version or the output of `swift --version`
  * OS version and the output of `uname -a`
  * Network configuration


### Example

```
SwiftNIO commit hash: 22ec043dc9d24bb011b47ece4f9ee97ee5be2757

Context:
While load testing my HTTP web server written with SwiftNIO, I noticed
that one file descriptor is leaked per request.

Steps to reproduce:
1. ...
2. ...
3. ...
4. ...

$ swift --version
Swift version 4.0.2 (swift-4.0.2-RELEASE)
Target: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu

Operating system: Ubuntu Linux 16.04 64-bit

$ uname -a
Linux beefy.machine 4.4.0-101-generic #124-Ubuntu SMP Fri Nov 10 18:29:59 UTC 2017 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

My system has IPv6 disabled.
```

## Writing a Patch

A good SwiftNIO patch is:

1. Concise, and contains as few changes as needed to achieve the end result.
2. Tested, ensuring that any tests provided failed before the patch and pass after it.
3. Documented, adding API documentation as needed to cover new functions and properties.
4. Accompanied by a great commit message, using our commit message template.

### Commit Message Template

We require that your commit messages match our template. The easiest way to do that is to get git to help you by explicitly using the template. To do that, `cd` to the root of our repository and run:

    git config commit.template dev/git.commit.template

The default policy for taking contributions is “Squash and Merge” - because of this the commit message format rule above applies to the PR rather than every commit contained within it.

### Make sure your patch works for all supported versions of swift

The CI will do this for you, but a project maintainer must kick it off for you.  Currently all versions of Swift >= 5.8 are supported.

If you wish to test this locally you have two options [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) and Docker Compose files.

#### Act

[Install act](https://nektosact.com/installation/) and then you can run the full suite of checks via:
```
act pull_request
```
Note that SwiftNIO matrix testing makes use of nightly builds, so you may want to make use of the ```--action-offline-mode``` to avoid repulling those.

#### Docker Compose files

You can use the docker-compose files.  For example usage of Docker Compose see the main [README](./README.md#an-alternative-using-docker-compose)

### Make sure your code is performant

SwiftNIO has been created to be high performance.  The integration tests cover some measures of performance including allocations which should be avoided if possible.  For help with allocation problems refer to the guide to [allocation debugging](./docs/debugging-allocations.md)

### Formatting

Try to keep your lines less than 120 characters long so github can correctly display your changes.

SwiftNIO uses the [swift-format](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-format) tool to bring consistency to code formatting.  There is a specific [.swift-format](./.swift-format) configuration file.  This will be checked and enforced on PRs.  Note that the check will run on the current most recent stable version target which may not match that in your own local development environment.

If you want to apply the formatting to your local repo before you commit then you can either run [check-swift-format.sh](./scripts/check-swift-format.sh) which will use your current toolchain, or to match the CI checks exactly you can use `act` (see [act section](#act)):
```
act --action-offline-mode --bind workflow_call -j format-check --input format_check_enabled=true
```

This will run the format checks, binding to your local checkout so the edits made are to your own source.


### Extensibility

Try to make sure your code is robust to future extensions.  The public interface is very hard to change after release - please refer to the [API guidelines](./docs/public-api.md)

## How to contribute your work

Please open a pull request at https://github.com/apple/swift-nio. Make sure the CI passes, and then wait for code review.

After review you may be asked to make changes.  When you are ready, use the request re-review feature of github or mention the reviewers by name in a comment.
