        // number of other functions, many of which are also available on regular file
        // handles.

        // This includes getting information about a file, such as its permissions, last access time,
        // and last modification time:
        let info = try await directory.info()

        // Once this closure returns the file system will close the directory handle freeing
        // any resources required to access it such as file descriptors. Handles can also be opened
        // with the 'openFile' and 'openDirectory' APIs but that places the onus you to close the
        // handle at an appropriate time to avoid leaking resources.
