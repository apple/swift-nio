/// A `Channel` with fine-grained control for testing.
///
/// ``NIOAsyncTestingChannel`` is a `Channel` implementation that does no
/// actual IO but that does have proper eventing mechanism, albeit one that users can
/// control. The prime use-case for ``NIOAsyncTestingChannel`` is in unit tests when you
/// want to feed the inbound events and check the outbound events manually.
///
/// Please remember to call ``finish()`` when you are no longer using this
/// ``NIOAsyncTestingChannel``.
///
/// To feed events through an ``NIOAsyncTestingChannel``'s `ChannelPipeline` use
/// ``NIOAsyncTestingChannel/writeInbound(_:)`` which accepts data of any type. It will then
/// forward that data through the `ChannelPipeline` and the subsequent
/// `ChannelInboundHandler` will receive it through the usual `channelRead`
/// event. The user is responsible for making sure the first
/// `ChannelInboundHandler` expects data of that type.
///
/// Unlike in a regular `ChannelPipeline`, it is expected that the test code will act
/// as the "network layer", using ``readOutbound(as:)`` to observe the data that the
/// `Channel` has "written" to the network, and using ``writeInbound(_:)`` to simulate
/// receiving data from the network. There are also facilities to make it a bit easier
/// to handle the logic for `write` and `flush` (using ``writeOutbound(_:)``), and to
/// extract data that passed the whole way along the channel in `channelRead` (using
/// ``readOutbound(as:)``. Below is a diagram showing the layout of a `ChannelPipeline`
/// inside a ``NIOAsyncTestingChannel``, including the functions that can be used to
/// inject and extract data at each end.
///
