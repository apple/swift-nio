/**
 * This header file contains a library of advanced C Pre-Processor (CPP) macros
 * which implement various useful functions, such as iteration, in the
 * pre-processor.
 *
 * Though the file name (quite validly) labels this as magic, there should be
 * enough documentation in the comments for a reader only casually familiar
 * with the CPP to be able to understand how everything works.
 *
 * The majority of the magic tricks used in this file are based on those
 * described by pfultz2 in his "Cloak" library:
 *
 *    https://github.com/pfultz2/Cloak/wiki/C-Preprocessor-tricks,-tips,-and-idioms
 *
 * Major differences are a greater level of detailed explanation in this
 * implementation and also a refusal to include any macros which require a O(N)
 * macro definitions to handle O(N) arguments (with the exception of DEFERn).

/**
 * Force the pre-processor to expand the macro a large number of times. Usage:
 *
 *   EVAL(expression)
 *
 * This is useful when you have a macro which evaluates to a valid macro
 * expression which is not subsequently expanded in the same pass. A contrived,
 * but easy to understand, example of such a macro follows. Note that though
 * this example is contrived, this behaviour is abused to implement bounded
 * recursion in macros such as FOR.
 *
 *   #define A(x) x+1
 *   #define EMPTY
 *   #define NOT_QUITE_RIGHT(x) A EMPTY (x)
 *   NOT_QUITE_RIGHT(999)
 *
 * Here's what happens inside the C preprocessor:
 *
 * 1. It sees a macro "NOT_QUITE_RIGHT" and performs a single macro expansion
 *    pass on its arguments. Since the argument is "999" and this isn't a macro,
 *    this is a boring step resulting in no change.
 * 2. The NOT_QUITE_RIGHT macro is substituted for its definition giving "A
 *    EMPTY() (x)".
 * 3. The expander moves from left-to-right trying to expand the macro:
 *    The first token, A, cannot be expanded since there are no brackets
 *    immediately following it. The second token EMPTY(), however, can be
 *    expanded (recursively in this manner) and is replaced with "".
 * 4. Expansion continues from the start of the substituted test (which in this
 *    case is just empty), and sees "(999)" but since no macro name is present,
 *    nothing is done. This results in a final expansion of "A (999)".
 *
 * Unfortunately, this doesn't quite meet expectations since you may expect that
 * "A (999)" would have been expanded into "999+1". Unfortunately this requires
 * a second expansion pass but luckily we can force the macro processor to make
 * more passes by abusing the first step of macro expansion: the preprocessor
 * expands arguments in their own pass. If we define a macro which does nothing
 * except produce its arguments e.g.:
 *
 *   #define PASS_THROUGH(...) __VA_ARGS__
 *
 * We can now do "PASS_THROUGH(NOT_QUITE_RIGHT(999))" causing "NOT_QUITE_RIGHT" to be
 * expanded to "A (999)", as described above, when the arguments are expanded.
 * Now when the body of PASS_THROUGH is expanded, "A (999)" gets expanded to
 * "999+1".
 *
 * The EVAL defined below is essentially equivalent to a large nesting of
 * "PASS_THROUGH(PASS_THROUGH(PASS_THROUGH(..." which results in the
 * preprocessor making a large number of expansion passes over the given
 * expression.

 *
 * Usage:

 *    simply IN_NEXT_PASS. Since this is a function-style macro and it has no
 *    arguments, nothing will happen.
 * 2. The body of DEFER1 will now be expanded resulting in EMPTY() being

 *    since the macro expander has already passed IN_NEXT_PASS by the time it
 *    expands EMPTY() and so it won't spot that the brackets which remain can be
 *    applied to IN_NEXT_PASS.
 * 3. At this point the macro expansion completes. If one more pass is made,

 *    only a single 0, but e.g a C cast or some arithmetic operation that will

/**
 * Macro map/list comprehension. Usage:
 *
 *   MAP(op, sep, ...)
 *
 * Produces a 'sep()'-separated list of the result of op(arg) for each arg.
 *
 * Example Usage:
 *
 *   #define MAKE_HAPPY(x) happy_##x
 *   #define COMMA() ,
 *   MAP(MAKE_HAPPY, COMMA, 1,2,3)
 *
 * Which expands to:
 *
 *    happy_1 , happy_2 , happy_3
 *
 * How it works:
 *
 * 1. The MAP macro simply maps the inner MAP_INNER function in an EVAL which
 *    forces it to be expanded a large number of times, thus enabling many steps
 *    of iteration (see step 6).
 * 2. The MAP_INNER macro is substituted for its body.
 * 3. In the body, op(cur_val) is substituted giving the value for this
 *    iteration.
 * 4. The IF macro expands according to whether further iterations are required.
 *    This expansion either produces _IF_0 or _IF_1.
 * 5. Since the IF is followed by a set of brackets containing the "if true"
 *    clause, these become the argument to _IF_0 or _IF_1. At this point, the
 *    macro in the brackets will be expanded giving the separator followed by
 *    _MAP_INNER EMPTY()()(op, sep, __VA_ARGS__).
 * 5. If the IF was not taken, the above will simply be discarded and everything
 *    stops. If the IF is taken, The expression is then processed a second time
 *    yielding "_MAP_INNER()(op, sep, __VA_ARGS__)". Note that this call looks
 *    very similar to the  essentially the same as the original call except the
 *    first argument has been dropped.
 * 6. At this point expansion of MAP_INNER will terminate. However, since we can
 *    force more rounds of expansion using EVAL1. In the argument-expansion pass
 *    of the EVAL1, _MAP_INNER() is expanded to MAP_INNER which is then expanded
 *    using the arguments which follow it as in step 2-5. This is followed by a
 *    second expansion pass as the substitution of EVAL1() is expanded executing
 *    2-5 a second time. This results in up to two iterations occurring. Using
 *    many nested EVAL1 macros, i.e. the very-deeply-nested EVAL macro, will in
 *    this manner produce further iterations, hence the outer MAP macro doing
 *    this for us.
 *
 * Important tricks used:
 *
 * * If we directly produce "MAP_INNER" in an expansion of MAP_INNER, a special
 *   case in the preprocessor will prevent it being expanded in the future, even
 *   if we EVAL.  As a result, the MAP_INNER macro carefully only expands to
 *   something containing "_MAP_INNER()" which requires a further expansion step
 *   to invoke MAP_INNER and thus implementing the recursion.
 * * To prevent _MAP_INNER being expanded within the macro we must first defer its
 *   expansion during its initial pass as an argument to _IF_0 or _IF_1. We must
 *   then defer its expansion a second time as part of the body of the _IF_0. As
 *   a result hence the DEFER2.
 * * _MAP_INNER seemingly gets away with producing itself because it actually only
 *   produces MAP_INNER. It just happens that when _MAP_INNER() is expanded in
 *   this case it is followed by some arguments which get consumed by MAP_INNER
 *   and produce a _MAP_INNER.  As such, the macro expander never marks
 *   _MAP_INNER as expanding to itself and thus it will still be expanded in
 *   future productions of itself.
