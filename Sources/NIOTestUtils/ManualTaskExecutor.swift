/// Example usage:
/// ```swift
///     await withDiscardingTaskGroup { group in
///         await withManualTaskExecutor { taskExecutor in
///             group.addTask(executorPreference: taskExecutor) {

///         }
///     }

/// - warning: Do not escape the task executor from the closure for later use and make sure that
///            all tasks running on the executor are completely finished before `body` returns.
///            It is highly recommended to use structured concurrency with this task executor.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - body: The closure that will accept the task executor.
///
/// - Throws: When `body` throws.
///
/// - Returns: The value returned by `body`.
