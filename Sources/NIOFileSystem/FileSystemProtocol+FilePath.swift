    /// `shouldProceedAfterError`.
    /// In the event of any errors (ignored or otherwise) implementations are under no obbligation to
    /// attempt to 'tidy up' after themselves. The state of the file system within `destinationPath`
    /// after an aborted copy should is undefined.

    /// When calling `shouldProceedAfterError` implementations of this method
    /// MUST:
    ///  - Do so once and only once per item.
    ///  - Not hold any locks when doing so.
    /// MAY:
    ///  - invoke the function multiple times concurrently (except when using ``CopyStrategy/sequential``)

    ///     * if a parent is ignored no items within it should be considered or checked
    ///  - Skip all contents of a directory which is filtered out.
    ///  - Invoke it for the `sourcePath` itself.
