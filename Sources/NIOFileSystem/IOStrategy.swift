enum IOStrategy: Hashable, Sendable {
    // platformDefault is reified into one of the concrete options below:
    case sequential
    case parallel(_ maxDescriptors: Int)

    // These selections are relatively arbitrary but the rationale is as follows:
    //
    // - Never exceed the default OS limits even if 4 such operations were happening at once.
    // - Sufficient to enable significant speed up from parallelism
    // - Not wasting effort by pushing contention to the underlying storage device. Further we
    //   assume an SSD or similar underlying storage tech. Users on spinning rust need to account
    //   for that themselves anyway.
    //
    // That said, empirical testing for this has not been performed, suggestions welcome.
    //
    // Note: The directory scan is modelled after a copy strategy needing two handles: during the
    // creation of the destination directory we hold the handle while copying attributes. A much
    // more complex internal state machine could allow doing two of these if desired. This may not
    // result in a faster copy though so things are left simple.

        // and subdirectories of similar shape) to the same volume, totalling 12GB. Results showed
        // improvements in elapsed time for (expected) increases in CPU time up to parallel(8).
