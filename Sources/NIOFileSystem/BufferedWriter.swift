/// You can create a ``BufferedWriter`` by calling

/// ``WritableFileHandleProtocol`` and write bytes to it with one of the following methods:
/// - ``BufferedWriter/write(contentsOf:)-1rkf6``
/// - ``BufferedWriter/write(contentsOf:)-7cs3v``
/// - ``BufferedWriter/write(contentsOf:)-66cts``
///
/// If a call to one of the write functions reaches the buffers ``BufferedWriter/capacity`` the

///
/// To write the bytes in the buffer to the file system before the buffer is full
/// use ``BufferedWriter/flush()``.
