# ``NIOFileSystem``

> Warning: Do not use this module. Instead use [`_NIOFileSystem`][_fs-docs].
>
> `NIOFileSystem` currently exposes the same API as `_NIOFileSystem`, which is not API stable. `NIOFileSystem`
> was created in error, and its lack of underscore incorrectly implies API stability. Users who are currently importing
> `NIOFileSystem` should move to `_NIOFileSystem`.
>
> Refer to [`_NIOFilesystem`][_fs-docs] for documentation on the API of this module.
>
> There is ongoing work in NIO to provide a filesystem library with a stable API.
