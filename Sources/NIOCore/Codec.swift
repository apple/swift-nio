/// `ByteToMessageDecoder`s decode bytes in a stream-like fashion from `ByteBuffer` to another message type.
///
/// ### Purpose
///
/// A `ByteToMessageDecoder` provides a simplified API for handling streams of incoming data that can be broken
/// up into messages. This API boils down to two methods: `decode`, and `decodeLast`. These two methods, when
/// implemented, will be used by a `ByteToMessageHandler` paired with a `ByteToMessageDecoder` to decode the
/// incoming byte stream into a sequence of messages.
///
/// The reason this helper exists is to smooth away some of the boilerplate and edge case handling code that
/// is often necessary when implementing parsers in a SwiftNIO `ChannelPipeline`. A `ByteToMessageDecoder`
/// never needs to worry about how inbound bytes will be buffered, as `ByteToMessageHandler` deals with that
/// automatically. A `ByteToMessageDecoder` also never needs to worry about memory exclusivity violations
/// that can occur when re-entrant `ChannelPipeline` operations occur, as `ByteToMessageHandler` will deal with
/// those as well.
///
/// ### Implementing ByteToMessageDecoder
///
/// A type that implements `ByteToMessageDecoder` may implement two methods: decode and decodeLast. Implementations
/// must implement decode: if they do not implement decodeLast, a default implementation will be used that 
/// simply calls decode.
///
/// `decode` is the main decoding method, and is the one that will be called most often. `decode` is invoked
/// whenever data is received by the wrapping `ByteToMessageHandler`. It is invoked with a `ByteBuffer` containing
/// all the received data (including any data previously buffered), as well as a `ChannelHandlerContext` that can be
/// used in the `decode` function.
///
/// `decode` is called in a loop by the `ByteToMessageHandler`. This loop continues until one of two cases occurs:
///
/// 1. The input `ByteBuffer` has no more readable bytes (i.e. `.readableBytes == 0`); OR
/// 2. The `decode` method returns `.needMoreData`.
///
/// The reason this method is invoked in a loop is to ensure that the stream-like properties of inbound data are
/// respected. It is entirely possible for `ByteToMessageDecoder` to receive either fewer bytes than a single message,
/// or multiple messages in one go. Rather than have the `ByteToMessageDecoder` handle all of the complexity of this,
/// the logic can be boiled down to a single choice: has the `ByteToMessageDecoder` been able to move the state forward
/// or not? If it has, rather than containing an internal loop it may simply return `.continue` in order to request that
/// `decode` be invoked again immediately. If it has not, it can return `.needMoreData` to ask to be left alone until more
/// data has been returned from the network.
///
/// Essentially, if the next parsing step could not be taken because there wasn't enough data available, return `.needMoreData`.
/// Otherwise, return `.continue`. This will allow a `ByteToMessageDecoder` implementation to ignore the awkward way data
/// arrives from the network, and to just treat it as a series of `decode` calls.
///
/// `decodeLast` is a cousin of `decode`. It is also called in a loop, but unlike with `decode` this loop will only ever
/// occur once: when the `ChannelHandlerContext` belonging to this `ByteToMessageDecoder` is about to become invalidated.
/// This invalidation happens in two situations: when EOF is received from the network, or when the `ByteToMessageDecoder`
/// is being removed from the `ChannelPipeline`. The distinction between these two states is captured by the value of
/// `seenEOF`.
///
/// In this condition, the `ByteToMessageDecoder` must now produce any final messages it can with the bytes it has
/// available. In protocols where EOF is used as a message delimiter, having `decodeLast` called with `seenEOF == true`
/// may produce further messages. In other cases, `decodeLast` may choose to deliver any buffered bytes as "leftovers",
/// either in error messages or via `channelRead`. This can occur if, for example, a protocol upgrade is occurring.
///
/// As with `decode`, `decodeLast` is invoked in a loop. This allows the same simplification as `decode` allows: when
/// a message is completely parsed, the `decodeLast` function can return `.continue` and be re-invoked from the top,
/// rather than containing an internal loop.
///
/// Note that the value of `seenEOF` may change between calls to `decodeLast` in some rare situations.
///
/// ### Implementers Notes
///
/// `ByteToMessageHandler` will turn your `ByteToMessageDecoder` into a `ChannelInboundHandler`. `ByteToMessageHandler`
/// also solves a couple of tricky issues for you. Most importantly, in a `ByteToMessageDecoder` you do _not_ need to
/// worry about re-entrancy. Your code owns the passed-in `ByteBuffer` for the duration of the `decode`/`decodeLast` call and
/// can modify it at will.
///
/// If a custom frame decoder is required, then one needs to be careful when implementing
/// one with `ByteToMessageDecoder`. Ensure there are enough bytes in the buffer for a
/// complete frame by checking `buffer.readableBytes`. If there are not enough bytes
/// for a complete frame, return without modifying the reader index to allow more bytes to arrive.
///
/// To check for complete frames without modifying the reader index, use methods like `buffer.getInteger`.
/// You  _MUST_ use the reader index when using methods like `buffer.getInteger`.
/// For example calling `buffer.getInteger(at: 0)` is assuming the frame starts at the beginning of the buffer, which
/// is not always the case. Use `buffer.getInteger(at: buffer.readerIndex)` instead.
///
/// If you move the reader index forward, either manually or by using one of `buffer.read*` methods, you must ensure
/// that you no longer need to see those bytes again as they will not be returned to you the next time `decode` is
/// called. If you still need those bytes to come back, consider taking a local copy of buffer inside the function to
/// perform your read operations on.
///
/// The `ByteBuffer` passed in as `buffer` is a slice of a larger buffer owned by the `ByteToMessageDecoder`
/// implementation. Some aspects of this buffer are preserved across calls to `decode`, meaning that any changes to
/// those properties you make in your `decode` method will be reflected in the next call to decode. In particular,
/// moving the reader index forward persists across calls. When your method returns, if the reader index has advanced,
/// those bytes are considered "consumed" and will not be available in future calls to `decode`.
/// Please note, however, that the numerical value of the `readerIndex` itself is not preserved, and may not be the same
/// from one call to the next. Please do not rely on this numerical value: if you need
/// to recall where a byte is relative to the `readerIndex`, use an offset rather than an absolute value.
///
