/// A list of `ChannelHandler`s that handle or intercept inbound events and outbound operations of a
/// `Channel`. `ChannelPipeline` implements an advanced form of the Intercepting Filter pattern
/// to give a user full control over how an event is handled and how the `ChannelHandler`s in a pipeline
/// interact with each other.
///
/// # Creation of a pipeline
///
/// Each `Channel` has its own `ChannelPipeline` and it is created automatically when a new `Channel` is created.
///
/// # How an event flows in a pipeline
///
/// The following diagram describes how I/O events are typically processed by `ChannelHandler`s in a `ChannelPipeline`.
/// An I/O event is handled by either a `ChannelInboundHandler` or a `ChannelOutboundHandler`
/// and is forwarded to the next handler in the `ChannelPipeline` by calling the event propagation methods defined in
/// `ChannelHandlerContext`, such as `ChannelHandlerContext.fireChannelRead` and
/// `ChannelHandlerContext.write`.

///
/// An inbound event is handled by the inbound handlers in the head-to-tail direction as shown on the left side of the
/// diagram. An inbound handler usually handles the inbound data generated by the I/O thread on the bottom of the
/// diagram. The inbound data is often read from a remote peer via the actual input operation such as
/// `Socket.read`. If an inbound event goes beyond the tail inbound handler, it is discarded
/// silently, or logged if it needs your attention.
///
/// An outbound event is handled by the outbound handlers in the tail-to-head direction as shown on the right side of the
/// diagram. An outbound handler usually generates or transforms the outbound traffic such as write requests.
/// If an outbound event goes beyond the head outbound handler, it is handled by an I/O thread associated with the
/// `Channel`. The I/O thread often performs the actual output operation such as `Socket.write`.
///
///
/// For example, let us assume that we created the following pipeline:
///
/// ```
/// ChannelPipeline p = ...
/// let future = p.add(name: "1", handler: InboundHandlerA()).flatMap {
///   p.add(name: "2", handler: InboundHandlerB())
/// }.flatMap {
///   p.add(name: "3", handler: OutboundHandlerA())
/// }.flatMap {
///   p.add(name: "4", handler: OutboundHandlerB())
/// }.flatMap {
///   p.add(name: "5", handler: InboundOutboundHandlerX())
/// }
/// // Handle the future as well ....
/// ```
///
/// In the example above, a class whose name starts with `Inbound` is an inbound handler.
/// A class whose name starts with `Outbound` is an outbound handler.
///
/// In the given example configuration, the handler evaluation order is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 when an event goes inbound.
/// When an event goes outbound, the order is 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.  On top of this principle, `ChannelPipeline` skips
/// the evaluation of certain handlers to shorten the stack depth:
///
/// - 3 and 4 don't implement `ChannelInboundHandler`, and therefore the actual evaluation order of an inbound event will be: 1, 2, and 5.
/// - 1 and 2 don't implement `ChannelOutboundHandler`, and therefore the actual evaluation order of a outbound event will be: 5, 4, and 3.
/// - If 5 implements both `ChannelInboundHandler` and `ChannelOutboundHandler`, the evaluation order of an inbound and a outbound event could be 125 and 543 respectively.
///
/// - Note: Handlers may choose not to propagate messages down the pipeline immediately.  For example a handler may need to wait
/// for additional data before sending a protocol event to the next handler in the pipeline.  Due to this you can't assume that later handlers
/// in the pipeline will receive the same number of events as were sent, or that events of different types will arrive in the same order.
/// For example - a user event could overtake a data event if a handler is aggregating data events before propagating but immediately
/// propagating user events.
///
/// # Forwarding an event to the next handler
///
/// As you might noticed in the diagram above, a handler has to invoke the event propagation methods in
/// `ChannelHandlerContext` to forward an event to its next handler.
/// Those methods include:
///
/// - Inbound event propagation methods defined in `ChannelInboundInvoker`
/// - Outbound event propagation methods defined in `ChannelOutboundInvoker`.
///
/// # Building a pipeline
///
/// A user is supposed to have one or more `ChannelHandler`s in a `ChannelPipeline` to receive I/O events (e.g. read) and
/// to request I/O operations (e.g. write and close).  For example, a typical server will have the following handlers
/// in each channel's pipeline, but your mileage may vary depending on the complexity and characteristics of the
/// protocol and business logic:
///
/// - Protocol Decoder - translates binary data (e.g. `ByteBuffer`) into a struct / class
/// - Protocol Encoder - translates a struct / class into binary data (e.g. `ByteBuffer`)
/// - Business Logic Handler - performs the actual business logic (e.g. database access)
///
/// # Thread safety
///
/// A `ChannelHandler` can be added or removed at any time because a `ChannelPipeline` is thread safe.
