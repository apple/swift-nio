/// A ``NIOAsyncChannelOutboundWriter`` is used to write and flush new outbound messages in a channel.
///
/// The writer acts as a bridge between the Concurrency and NIO world. It allows to write and flush messages into the
/// underlying ``Channel``. Furthermore, it respects back-pressure of the channel by suspending the calls to write until
/// the channel becomes writable again.
