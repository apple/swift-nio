import CNIOSHA1

/// A single SHA1 hasher.
///
/// This structure is basically a shim around the SHA1 C implementation from
/// FreeBSD that can be found in `CNIOSHA1`. The fact that we are bringing our
/// own SHA1 implementation along with us is a bit disappointing, but currently
/// it is very difficult to use the operating system native libraries to get this
/// done without forcing a hard dependency on our libressl bindings (which would
/// bring along a dependency cycle for the ride).
///
/// We were disinclined to roll our own because we don't want to have to trust
/// ourselves to get it right: the FreeBSD implementation here is battle-tested and
/// extremely trustworthy, and so is a far better solution than rolling our own.
///
/// At some point in the future the Swift standard library or Foundation may include
/// some hashing functions, or we may have platform-specific conditional deps in
/// SwiftPM. Until that time, we commit the minor sin of needing to call into C for
/// this.
